# Expense Tracker React App

A simple expense tracking app built with React.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and `install` the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/muhib7353/React-js-Blogs-and-Projects.git
cd Projects
cd Expense_Tracker
npm install
```

Then, you can start the development server with the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.
