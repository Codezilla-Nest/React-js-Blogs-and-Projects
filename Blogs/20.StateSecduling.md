# Navigating the State of React: Understanding and Utilizing State Scheduling

> Managing state in React can be a tricky task, especially when dealing with complex, multi-step interactions. One of the most recent additions to React's toolset for managing state is state scheduling. State scheduling allows for a more fine-grained control over the timing of state updates, making it easier to handle complex interactions and avoid unexpected behavior. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at state scheduling in React and explore how it can be used to improve the performance and predictability of your applications.

State scheduling is a feature in React that allows developers to have more control over when and how state updates are applied. It works by allowing React to "schedule" updates to state, rather than applying them immediately. This allows React to better handle situations where multiple updates need to be made, and to avoid any unexpected issues that might arise when updates are applied in the wrong order.

State scheduling was introduced as a part of the React concurrent mode, which allows React to schedule updates and render multiple components at the same time.

One of the most common use cases for state scheduling is handling complex interactions, such as form submissions or animations. Here's an example of how state scheduling can be used to handle a form submission:

```js
import { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const Form = () => {
  const [submitting, setSubmitting] = useState(false);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({});

  const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
    setSubmitting(true);
    setFormData({});
    // simulate an async submit
    setTimeout(() => {
      setSubmitting(false);
    }, 2000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        name="name"
        value={formData.name}
        onChange={(event) => setFormData(event.target.value)}
      />
      <button type="submit" disabled={submitting}>
        Submit
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

In this example, the handleSubmit function is called when the form is submitted. The first thing it does is set the submitting state to true, which disables the submit button to prevent multiple submissions. Next, it clears the form data by setting it to an empty object. Finally, it simulates an async submit by using setTimeout and sets the submitting state to false after 2 seconds.

As you can see, the state updates are scheduled by React, so it knows that it should wait to apply the submitting state update until the formData state update has been applied. This prevents any unexpected issues that might arise if the submitting state update were applied first, such as the form data being lost before it could be submitted.

State scheduling can also be used to optimize performance by allowing React to batch updates together, and apply them all at once. This can be particularly beneficial when dealing with large lists or complex animations.

In summary, state scheduling is a powerful feature in React that allows developers to have more control over when and how state updates are applied. By using state scheduling, developers can handle complex interactions more easily and avoid unexpected issues that might arise when updates are applied in the wrong order.
