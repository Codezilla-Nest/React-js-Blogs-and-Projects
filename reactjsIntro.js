/*Why we need react.js ?
 In traditional javscript, we see every piece of tag and its functionality can be written manually.And in Large Applications like Netflix, we don't have to fetch every HTML file on requesting.We want nice transitions without any fetching and loading files.
 React has the custom HTML components.Each component can be written in a declative way rather than imperative.

 SPAs?
 React js make web application as a single page application.Means on every click on the link it does not fetch any new html file to render them on the screenn it can actually change teh javascript code to what now visilbe on the screen.Only initial request can be done on the server, then there is no any second request can be done.

 React is component based.Depends upon the community libraries for the more features.
 Angular is also the component based.But it is very least depends upon the third party libraries.USes Typescript.
 Vue.js is also the comonent based it is mid between React and Angular.
